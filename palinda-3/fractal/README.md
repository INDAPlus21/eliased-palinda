## How many CPUs does you program use? How much faster is your parallel version?
My current go version is 1.14, so I'm NOT using as many OS threads as possible. So I need to tell the program how many threads it should use with GOMAXPROCS, but the other people have it for free (but they still need to do the main bit of the task). It took 11.04 seconds to complete 7 images, and 35 seconds to complete all the 8 images without the use of any optimizations. It took 6 seconds to complete all the images with the use of parallel computation.
